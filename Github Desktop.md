# What is Github Desktop?

Github desktop is an application designed and maintained by Github for users to contribute in a very easy and friendly way.
## Advantages :
1. Users can create, edit, commit changes without using git.
2. No Command line usage so no complexity of remembering commands.
3. Easy to use especially while contributing in contests like GSoC, Outreachy, ESoC, Hacktoberfest, GSSoC, etc.
4. Once a repository is cloned, can be used anytime through this application.

Basic requirement:
#### Sometimes it will ask you to install git for vscode. Depends upon the situation. For better preference install git. It has nothing to do with Github desktop but for vscode. Although you will contribute through Github desktop and no commands using git, then also install git.
