If its fake then it will shows some message or error or no actual details. 

### suppose this one: 
    https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

it will show this message if you test, its fake:

# Congratulations! You learned to use Postman, now you can test any api, post issues in api and perform operations in apis using Postman.
