# What is a Github Desktop?

Github desktop is an application designed and maintained by Github for users to contribute in a very easy and friendly way.
## Advantages :
1. Users can create, edit, commit changes without using git.
2. No Command line usage so no complexity of remembering commands.
3. Easy to use especially while contributing in contests like GSoC, Outreachy, ESoC, Hacktoberfest, GSSoC, etc.
4. Once a repository is cloned, can be used anytime through this application.

Basic requirement:
#### Sometimes it will ask you to install git for vscode. Depends upon the situation. For better preference install git. It has nothing to do with Github desktop but for vscode. Although you will contribute through Github desktop and no commands using git, then also install git.

# How to use

### Step 3 : Open GitHub Desktop, sign in with Github account. Do some basic setup like choosing theme and all. 

### Step 4 : Go to GitHub, choose a repository you want to contribute. Suppose you want to contribute in this repository named Python Snippet by DahlitzFlorian.

It will automatically open Github desktop showing to clone the repository.

### Step 7 : Choose the desired location to clone to repository. Suppose I chose a folder named Opensource(initially created) in my F drive. Then click on clone.

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff6958c-bcba-45be-9fc0-197714f7b75b)

Wait for sometimes until it gets cloned, the cloning time depends upon the size and data of repository. For small size or less data based repository, it takes very less time and vice versa.

### Step 8: Choose how you want to use it. To contribute in original repository click on parent project and if personal experimentation choose For my own purpose. Here i want to contribute in original repository so I am choosing Parent Project option and click continue.

### Step 9: First create new branch to contribute, go to current branch option on the top, then click on new branch.

### Step 10: Suppose you want to contribute a code of fibonacci series, so you may create a branch named fibonacci-series

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a967421-e73c-41e6-a496-aaa29244d858)

### Step 11: Now I can contribute easily through vscode, so click on open in vscode option.

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/957d1125-33a5-434c-a631-d5937176711d)

It will automatically open vs code with all datas of the cloned repository.

### Step 11: Since in this repository, all python codes are in a folder named standard-lib, so I will create a new python file under this folder named fibonacci.py

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/434bcd00-a80c-41f7-913b-bf879f0063b0)

### Step 12: Then write the code of fibonacci series and save under the same folder.

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa226bf-af7a-48c9-b955-2f1aaa2d9f37)

### Step 13: Now open Github desktop, you will see some changes. on the bottom left, there is a description bar. Fill it(optional) like I am creating fibonacci series, so i filled it as "create Fibonacci.py" and in description i mentioned "shows Fibonacci series based on user input." Now click on commit.

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3460c578-11db-46f6-ae3e-936195a30679)

It will automatically open Github

### Step 16: Add details about your contribution(title and description). Then click on pull request option. 

Note : Before clicking on pull request, if you want the maintainers/owners not to edit the changes of yours then remove the blue tick by clicking on "Allow edits by maintainers"  option beside the "Create pull request" option, otherwise don't click. Since my code is simple, I left it as it is. If they want they can change/rectify. Its optional and depends upon your choice.

### Then click on create pull request.

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daad58f1-8e93-4e2e-b687-dd574c22555c)

### Step 17: It will show if there is any conflict or not. Some may have test cases. If all passed then the maintainer or owner will merge the contribution after sometimes if they view and are satisfied from your contribution.
